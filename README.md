texwatcher
============

Texwatcher is a quick script I put together for working with tex files. Texwatcher will watch tex files on disk and recompile them as they are updated.

Usage
-----

    texwatcher <main source file>

To Dos
------
- give usage example on improper usage
- expose configuration options (compiler, file search scope, etc.)
- error recovery when compiler encounters errors
- documentation for setup
